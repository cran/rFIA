# rFIA v1.2.0

This version implements a variety of updates to model estimation functions after a complete validation of the package's functionality. An extensive suite of unit tests are implemented for checking `rFIA` estimates with estimates from EVALIDator to ensure consistency of rFIA with updates in FIADB. This validation assessment fixed multiple bugs, particularly related to the reporting of sample sizes that were not always consistent dependent on different filtering criteria implemented in the estimation functions. Updates are broken down in the following based on specific functions.  

Full details on this validation are provided in the development version of `rFIA` on GitHub in the `core_references/validation` directory. Note that Claude Code was used to aid in the validation assessment, with code verified by Jeff Doser. 

### `customPSE()`

+ Fixed a bug in `customPSE()` (GitHub issue #47) where a spatial mask (or any multi-state call)
  spanning states with different `mostRecent` evaluation years returned one row per state/year instead
  of a single combined estimate, unlike `area()`/`tpa()`/etc. on the same masked data. Root cause:
  `customPSE()` checked `db` for `clipFIA(mostRecent = TRUE)`'s marker *after* an internal helper had
  already pared `db` down to only the named FIA tables, which silently dropped that marker -- so the
  step that relabels differing per-state "most recent" years to a common year before combining never
  ran. Every other estimator dispatcher checks this before any table-paring happens, so none of them
  were affected. 
+ Fixed a bug in `customPSE()` where `nPlots_x`/`nPlots_y` were inflated to the full forested-plot
  count instead of the true number of non-zero contributing plots, whenever `x`/`y` was a tree-based
  list (e.g. the `treeList = TRUE` output of `tpa()`/`volume()`). Point estimates and standard errors
  were unaffected -- this was purely a plot-count/reporting bug, but it mattered because `customPSE.Rd`
  documents `nPlots_x`/`nPlots_y` as the count of *non-zero* plots, used as the degrees of freedom for
  a t-based confidence interval. Root cause: `sumToPlot()` (`R/util.R`), shared by every estimator, did
  not filter out the phantom `TREE_BASIS`/`AREA_BASIS = NA` rows that a `treeList`/`condList` output
  necessarily includes for forested conditions with zero qualifying trees -- each `*Starter.R` file
  already filters these before its own population-estimate call, but `customPSE()` calls `sumToPlot()`
  directly on user-supplied data. Confirmed against `tpa()`/`volume()`/`area()` across four states (one
  per FIA region). 
+ Fixed a `dplyr::across()` deprecation warning in `customPSE()` (`...` was passed through to `.fns`
  rather than wrapped in an anonymous function, deprecated as of dplyr 1.1.0).

### Changes to multiple functions

+ `tpa()`, `biomass()`, `carbon()`, `volume()`, `growMort()`, `vitalRates()`, `diversity()`, `fsi()`,
  `area()`, `areaChange()`, `standStruct()`, and `seedling()` now warn when `grpBy` includes `SUBP`.
  Unlike every other `grpBy` variable these functions support (species, size class, ownership group,
  etc.), which partition trees/conditions within the same shared sampled area, `SUBP` denotes a
  physically distinct sub-area of the plot -- each subplot covers different ground. Grouping by `SUBP`
  still produces a mathematically valid partition of the plot-level per-acre estimate (each subplot's
  value is its share of the total, and the four values sum back to the ungrouped estimate exactly), but
  it is not a re-weighted, subplot-local density, since the area denominator is not re-weighted to match
  each subplot's own area. Documented in each function's `Details` section (issue #31). This warning is 
  used to reflect that `rFIA` is not designed for extracting data for each subplot and subsequently using
  that data within a model-based estimator. 
+ Fixed a bug in the shared internal utility used to evaluate a user-supplied `areaDomain` where the plots/conditions used to evaluate the domain expression were hard-coded to forest land (`PLOT_STATUS_CD == 1`/`COND_STATUS_CD == 1`), regardless of `landType`. This caused `area()` (and `areaChange()`) to silently return zero area for any combination of a non-forest `landType` (e.g. `'water'`, `'non-forest'`, `'all'`) with an `areaDomain` filter, instead of applying the filter and returning the correctly restricted estimate. This is a rare use case. 
+ Fixed a bug where `treeType = 'dead'` did not require dead trees to meet the "standing dead" tally-tree criteria (`STANDING_DEAD_CD == 1`), instead counting all trees with `STATUSCD == 2` regardless of whether they were still standing. This inflated `treeType = 'dead'` estimates in states with a meaningful number of down or broken dead trees recorded in the tree table (e.g. North Carolina, where the estimate was roughly 4x too high). This affects every function that supports `treeType`: `tpa()`, `diversity()`, `biomass()`, `volume()`, and `fsi()`. As a consequence, `treeType = 'all'` (which includes every tree regardless of status) is no longer equal to `treeType = 'live'` plus `treeType = 'dead'`, since `'all'` still includes the non-standing dead trees that `'dead'` now excludes.


### `growMort()` and `vitalRates()`

+ Fixed a bug in `growMort()` and `vitalRates()` where `bySizeClass = TRUE` silently dropped removed
  (harvested) and dead trees whose current-cycle diameter went unmeasured -- common for trees that are
  too decayed, broken, or fully removed to measure at the time of remeasurement. `sizeClass` was
  computed from the tree's current diameter and any row with a missing value was dropped before it was
  ever joined to the growth/mortality/removal tables, even though those same tables already provide a
  usable midpoint or begin diameter for exactly these trees. Confirmed against OR, where this undercut
  `growMort()`'s harvested-basal-area estimate by up to 99% and its mortality estimate by up to 25% when
  `bySizeClass = TRUE`; `bySizeClass = TRUE` totals (summed back across size classes) now match
  `bySizeClass = FALSE` exactly in both functions (issue #40).
+ `growMort()` now returns `nPlots_RECR`, `nPlots_MORT`, `nPlots_REMV`, and `nPlots_GROW` -- separate
  non-zero-plot counts for recruitment, mortality, harvest removal, and survivor growth, respectively.
  The first three were already documented in `growMort.Rd` but never actually implemented;
  `nPlots_GROW` is a new addition alongside them for consistency. Previously, only a single generic
  `nPlots_TREE` (count of plots contributing to *any* of recruitment/mortality/removal/survivor-growth
  combined) was returned, which understates the degrees of freedom appropriate for a t-based confidence
  interval on an individual `MORT_*`/`REMV_*`/`RECR_*`/`GROW_*` rate. `nPlots_TREE` is unchanged.
  Confirmed against EVALIDator's plot counts for the mortality/harvest-removal attributes (exact
  match).
+ Fixed a bug in `growMort()` where `GROW_*`/`CHNG_*` (survivor growth / net change) were computed
  incorrectly for every state variable except the default `TPA` -- `BAA`, volume, biomass, and carbon
  outputs were all affected. The previous-period population total was reconstructed using each departed
  tree's *midpoint* measurement (correct for the separately-reported `MORT_*`/`REMV_*` columns) instead
  of its *begin* measurement, which EVALIDator's own growth-accounting definition of "net growth"
  requires; a second, related bug caused mismatched `NA` handling across the `RECR`/`MORT`/`REMV`/`GROW`
  columns for volume-based state variables (`NETVOL`, `SAWVOL`, `SAWVOL_BF`), whose underlying FIADB
  columns are undefined for some trees below merchantability thresholds. `MORT_*`/`REMV_*` themselves,
  and every output under the default `stateVar = 'TPA'`, were unaffected. This is likely related to the
  "`growMort()` reporting zero survivor growth" bug fixed in v1.1.1.
+ Updated `growMort()` where state variables derived from tree biomass (`BIO_AG`, `BIO_BG`,
  `BIO`, `CARB_AG`, `CARB_BG`, `CARB`) to now be reported in pounds instead of short tons/acre. This is 
  for consistency with other estimation functions across the package. 
+ Fixed a bug in `growMort()` where an `areaDomain` filter was evaluated against a tree's *previous*
  remeasurement condition rather than its current one, understating `MORT_*`/`REMV_*`/`RECR_*` estimates
  in states with meaningful physiographic-class turnover between remeasurements (up to -6% in checks
  against EVALIDator). This is the same bug already fixed in `vitalRates()`.
+ Fixed a bug in `growMort()` where the `SUBP_COND_CHNG_MTRX`-based growth-accounting area-change
  calculation hardcoded `SUBPTYP == 1`, silently discarding area-change information for any condition
  measured on the macroplot and understating `landType = 'forest'` estimates (and `nPlots_AREA`) in
  macroplot-heavy states (e.g. Pacific Northwest). This is the same bug already fixed in `vitalRates()`.
+ Fixed a bug in `vitalRates()` where `SAWVOL_GROW`/`SAWVOL_GROW_AC` (sawlog board-foot volume
  growth) was computed from the same growing-stock growth-accounting component used for the other
  four growth metrics (`DIA_GROW`, `BA_GROW`, `NETVOL_GROW`, `BIO_GROW`), rather than the
  sawtimber-specific component EVALIDator's sawlog-volume growth attributes are actually defined
  against -- the same distinction `growMort()` already makes for its own `SAWVOL`/`SAWVOL_BF` state
  variables, independent of `treeType`. This under- or over-stated `SAWVOL_GROW_AC` by roughly
  0.3-3% depending on state. Point estimates and sampling errors for the other four growth metrics
  were not affected.
+ Updated `vitalRates()` where an `areaDomain` restriction (e.g. `PHYSCLCD %in% 21:29`) was
  applied to tree-level growth using the *previous* measurement's condition instead of the current
  one, while the area (denominator) side already correctly used the current condition -- creating a
  small, state-dependent mismatch (worse in states with more physiographic-class turnover between
  remeasurements) whenever a plot's `areaDomain`-relevant classification changed between visits.
  Point estimates for `areaDomain`-restricted calls were affected; unrestricted calls were not.
+ Fixed a bug in `vitalRates()` where `landType = 'forest'` silently dropped all area-change
  information for any condition whose proportion was measured on the macroplot (`COND.PROP_BASIS ==
  'MACR'`) rather than the standard subplot -- the internal area-change join hardcoded
  `SUBP_COND_CHNG_MTRX.SUBPTYP == 1`, when the FIA Population Estimation User Guide's own
  growth-accounting methodology requires `SUBPTYP == 3` for macroplot-basis conditions. This was
  invisible in states where forest conditions are exclusively subplot-basis (confirmed for RI, NC,
  CO), but caused a small, consistent undercount of `BIO_GROW_AC` (~-0.1%) and `nPlots_AREA` (~-0.6%)
  in Pacific/Western states that commonly use macroplot sampling (confirmed for OR, CA, WA). A
  residual, smaller discrepancy specific to `landType = 'timber'` exists with EVALIDator but is kept 
  different in `rFIA`. See details in `core_references` for more details.
+ Fixed a bug in `vitalRates()` where `nPlots_TREE` did not reflect restrictions imposed by
  `treeDomain` at all -- even a `treeDomain` matching zero trees left `nPlots_TREE` unchanged from the
  unrestricted value. Every row of a `bySpecies = TRUE` call reported the same, unrestricted
  `nPlots_TREE` regardless of how common that species actually was, defeating its use as the
  degrees of freedom for a t-based confidence interval. Root cause: the tree list's plot-count filter
  depended only on whether a tree had a valid growth-accounting record for the current
  `landType`/`treeType` (via FIA's precomputed `TREE_GRM_COMPONENT` columns), not on whether the
  user's `treeDomain`/`areaDomain` indicator (`tDI`) actually matched -- `tDI` only zeroed the growth
  values for non-matching trees, without excluding them from the plot count. Point estimates and
  sampling errors were not affected.
+ Fixed a bug in `vitalRates()` where `nPlots_AREA` did not reflect restrictions imposed by
  `landType` or `areaDomain` at all (the same class of bug already fixed in `tpa()`, `area()`,
  `carbon()`, `biomass()`, `volume()`, `dwm()`, `invasive()`, `seedling()`, `standStruct()`,
  `diversity()`, and `vegStruct()`; see above), including the same spurious/empty-result-with-warning
  edge case when a restriction matched no data. Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected.
+ Fixed a bug affecting `vitalRates()` and `growMort()` under `method = 'SMA'`/`'LMA'`/`'EMA'` where
  growth/mortality totals (and every ratio derived from them, e.g. `BIO_GROW_AC`, `MORT_TPA`) were
  inflated by roughly the number of remeasurement panels in the evaluation window -- up to ~9x in
  testing. Root cause: a shared internal utility (`sumToEU()`) that combines per-panel moving-average
  estimates into a single population estimate grouped the tree/growth side of the calculation by an
  extra, panel-varying column that should not have been part of the grouping key, preventing panels
  from actually being combined; `vitalRates()`/`growMort()`'s internal need to compute two related
  population estimates and join them together turned this into a many-to-many join that squared the
  row count. Every other estimator was unaffected in practice (a separate summation step downstream
  happened to still produce the correct total), which is why this was not caught until now. `method =
  'TI'` and `'ANNUAL'` were not affected.

### `fsi()`

+ Fixed a bug in `fsi()` where the plot-level remeasurement interval (`REMPER`) was incorrectly
  multiplied by the subplot/microplot/macroplot nonresponse adjustment factor before being used as a
  grouping key to recombine a plot's per-plot-basis rows back into a single row. Because that
  adjustment factor differs by plot basis, a single plot's rows ended up with different `REMPER`
  values and so failed to recombine, leaving the same physical plot represented by multiple rows.
  Tree-density sums still totaled correctly across those extra rows, but the subsequent area join (not
  keyed on `REMPER`) re-attached a full copy of that plot's forest-area weight to each spurious row,
  inflating the area denominator relative to the tree-count numerator. Values
  from `byPlot = TRUE` were not affected, since they do not go through this code path.
+ Fixed the informative prior on the intercept of `fsi()`'s maximum size-density curve (Bayesian
  quantile regression, `inst/extdata/qrLM.jag`/`qrLMM.jag`) to match Stanke et al. (2021): mean 7, not 6. 
  The slope prior was already correct.
+ Fixed `fsi()`'s exclusion of disturbed/treated plots from the maximum size-density curve calibration
  set to match Stanke et al. (2021): a plot showing evidence of disturbance *or* (non-natural-regen)
  silvicultural treatment is now excluded, rather than requiring both simultaneously. Previously, a
  plot with significant disturbance but no recorded follow-up treatment (e.g. an untreated wildfire)
  was incorrectly retained in the calibration set.
+ Removed the `totals` argument from `fsi()`. It had no effect on the returned output (both branches
  of the `totals`-dependent code returned identical columns) despite being documented as adding raw
  population totals; every other estimator's `totals` argument works as documented; `fsi()`'s did not
  and has been removed rather than implemented, since `FSI`/`PERC_FSI`/`PREV_RD`/`CURR_RD` are already
  ratio quantities with no natural population-total analog.
+ Fixed a bug where `fsi(areaDomain = ...)` crashed with `"replacement has 1 row, data has 0"` when the
  `areaDomain` (or `landType`) restricted the population to zero plots, instead of returning a clean
  empty result. `byPlot = FALSE` now returns a 0-row result in this case (or when a `treeDomain`
  matches zero trees, which previously returned a spurious 1-row result of `NaN`s instead of an empty
  result); `byPlot = TRUE` keeps all plot rows with `FSI = 0`/`NA`, consistent with how `tpa()` and
  `vitalRates()` already handle an empty domain.
+ Fixed a `dplyr::across()` deprecation warning raised by `fsi(method = 'ANNUAL')`.

### `vegStruct()`

+ Updated `vegStruct()` to now include region-specific `GROWTH_HABIT_CD`s as opposed to only 
  including the 5 core national vegetation growth-habit codes. 
+ Fixed a bug in `vegStruct()` where `byPlot = TRUE`'s per-plot cover estimate (`PROP_COVER`) used
  `mean(cover, na.rm = TRUE)` across a layer/growth-habit combination's subplot-level cover values,
  which treats a subplot where that combination wasn't recorded as a missing observation to exclude
  from the average rather than a real 0%-cover observation to include (the same bug already fixed in
  `invasive()`'s `byPlot` branch). This inflated `PROP_COVER` by up to 4x for a combination recorded on
  fewer than all 4 subplots -- the normal case for patchy vegetation. Fixed by dividing by a fixed 4
  subplots instead, matching the population-estimate branch's own formula. `byPlot = TRUE` was the only
  affected output; the main population-level `COVER_PCT` was not affected.
+ Fixed a bug in `vegStruct()` where `nPlots_AREA` did not reflect restrictions imposed by `landType`
  or `areaDomain` (the same class of bug already fixed in `tpa()`, `area()`, `carbon()`, `biomass()`,
  `volume()`, `dwm()`, `invasive()`, `seedling()`, `standStruct()`, and `diversity()`; see below), and
  an `areaDomain`/`landType` restriction matching no data could produce a spurious result instead of a
  clean empty one. Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected by either fix.
+ Fixed a bug where `method = 'SMA'`/`'LMA'`/`'EMA'`/`'ANNUAL'` could error with `"replacement has
  length zero"` instead of returning a result (or the existing "bad stratification" warning, when a
  stratum is genuinely too small to merge). This is not specific to `vegStruct()`: the underlying
  shared utility that pools too-small strata together (`R/util.R`, used by every `sumToEU()`-based
  estimator) picked a stratum's cross-year merge partner without accounting for a stratum whose
  `INVYR` is unknown -- reachable whenever a function restricts its plot universe before computing
  population weights (as `vegStruct()` and `invasive()` do, for their P2-ancillary-protocol sampling
  restrictions), which leaves some strata with no real year of their own. `tpa()`/`area()`/etc., which
  don't restrict their plot universe this way, were confirmed unaffected -- their output is unchanged.

### `diversity()`

+ Fixed a bug in `diversity()` where grouping by a `TREE`-table variable (`bySizeClass = TRUE`, or a
  user-supplied `grpBy` referencing a `TREE` column, e.g. species group) corrupted the area
  denominator: each forest condition's area was collapsed into whichever one grouping bin happened to
  be encountered first, instead of correctly contributing to every bin its trees actually belong to.
  This could push alpha-level Shannon's Equitability (`Eh_a`) above 1, which is mathematically
  impossible under its own formula. Fixed by separating the area-only grouping columns from the full
  grouping columns internally (matching `tpa()`'s existing `aGrpBy`/`grpBy` split), so a `TREE`-level
  grouping variable no longer fragments the area total. `grpBy` restricted to `PLOT`/`COND` columns
  (e.g. `OWNGRPCD`) was not affected.
+ Fixed a bug in `diversity()` where an `areaDomain`/`landType` restriction matching no data produced
  a spurious result (`H = S = 0` with a `"no non-missing arguments to max"` warning) instead of a
  clean empty result. `nPlots_AREA` also did not reflect restrictions imposed by `landType` or
  `areaDomain` (the same class of bug already fixed in `tpa()`, `area()`, `carbon()`, `biomass()`,
  `volume()`, `dwm()`, `invasive()`, `seedling()`, and `standStruct()`; see below). Point estimates and
  sampling errors were not affected by either fix.

### `standStruct()`

+ Fixed a bug in `standStruct()` where a forest condition with zero qualifying live trees (e.g. a
  young/sparse/non-stocked stand) survives the internal tree-list join as a phantom row indistinguishable
  from any other such condition on the same plot by `(PLT_CN, SUBP, TREE)` alone (`SUBP`/`TREE` are both
  `NA`). Whenever a single plot had two or more zero-tree forest conditions, `distinct(PLT_CN, SUBP,
  TREE)` collapsed them into one, silently dropping every zero-tree condition's area past the first from
  its stand structural stage ("mosaic") classification -- even though that area still correctly counted
  in the area total, so `COVER_PCT` summed across all four structural stages fell short of 100% (e.g.
  North Carolina: 99.986% instead of 100%). Fixed by adding `CONDID` to the deduplication key.
+ Fixed a bug in `standStruct()` where an `areaDomain`/`landType` restriction matching no data produced
  a spurious single-row `'mosaic'` result (with a `"no non-missing arguments to max"` warning) instead
  of a clean empty result, because the internal structural-stage classification step could still assign
  a fallback `'mosaic'` label to a plot with no real qualifying conditions. `nPlots_AREA` also did not
  reflect restrictions imposed by `landType` or `areaDomain` (the same class of bug already fixed in
  `tpa()`, `area()`, `carbon()`, `biomass()`, `volume()`, `dwm()`, `invasive()`, and `seedling()`; see
  below). Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected by either fix.

### `seedling()`

+ Fixed a bug in `seedling()` where the tree list's `distinct(PLT_CN, SUBP, SPCD)` deduplication key
  omitted `CONDID`. Unlike `TREE`, `SEEDLING` has no per-stem ID -- `TPA_UNADJ` is already a count
  pre-aggregated to the `PLT_CN`/`SUBP`/`CONDID`/`SPCD` grain by FIA -- so whenever a subplot straddled
  two conditions and the same species had seedlings recorded under both, this silently discarded one
  condition's count entirely. Confirmed on real data (North Carolina): this undercounted statewide
  seedling TPA by ~0.2%, moving it from 1228.331 to the correct 1230.528 (matching EVALIDator exactly)
  after the fix. Small/simple states (e.g. Rhode Island) rarely hit the triggering condition and were
  unaffected.
+ Fixed a bug in `seedling()` where `nPlots_TREE` counted every forest plot rather than just plots
  with at least one live seedling actually recorded, because its `TREE_BASIS` column (always `'MICR'`
  for seedlings) couldn't detect a phantom "no seedling" row the way `tpa()`'s `DIA`-derived
  `TREE_BASIS` does. Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected, only the reported plot count.
+ Fixed a bug in `seedling()` where `nPlots_AREA` did not reflect restrictions imposed by `landType` or
  `areaDomain` (the same class of bug already fixed in `tpa()`, `area()`, `carbon()`, `biomass()`,
  `volume()`, `dwm()`, and `invasive()`; see below -- `seedling()` was the one remaining estimator
  missing this fix). Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected.

### `invasive()`

+ Updated the internal `REF_PLANT_DICTIONARY` reference table (used by `invasive()` to attach a scientific/common name to each invasive species code) from an out-of-date snapshot to the current version provided by FIA. The previous version only included species-level PLANTS codes; genus-level codes (used whenever field crews identify an invasive plant's genus but not its exact species, e.g. `LIGUS2` for *Ligustrum* spp., a major invasive shrub genus in the southeastern US) were entirely absent. Because the name columns are part of `invasive()`'s internal grouping and its final output step drops any row with a missing group value, every genus-level species was silently dropped from the output entirely -- not just its name, but its real `COVER_PCT` data. This affected up to 36% of raw invasive-species records in the states checked (North Carolina). `tpa()`/`biomass()`/`volume()`'s analogous tree-species reference table was checked and does not have this problem.
+ Fixed a bug in `invasive()` where `byPlot = TRUE`'s per-plot cover estimate (`PROP_INV_COVER`) used `mean(cover, na.rm = TRUE)` across a species' subplot-level cover values, which treats a subplot where the species wasn't recorded as a missing observation to exclude from the average rather than a real 0%-cover observation to include. This inflated `PROP_INV_COVER` by up to 16x for a species detected on fewer than all 4 subplots -- the normal case for patchy invasive species. Fixed by dividing by a fixed 4 subplots instead. As part of this fix, `byPlot = TRUE` now also returns a `PROP_FOREST` column (the proportion of the plot meeting the land type/area domain, i.e. `CONDPROP_UNADJ`-weighted forest proportion), matching the same split already used by `biomass()`'s `byPlot = TRUE` output (`BIO_ACRE`/`PROP_FOREST`) -- `PROP_INV_COVER` itself is not weighted by plot forest proportion. `byPlot = TRUE` was the only affected output; the main population-level `COVER_PCT` was not affected.
+ Fixed a bug in `invasive()` where `nPlots_AREA` did not reflect restrictions imposed by `landType` or `areaDomain`, instead always reporting the plot count for the broader unrestricted land base (the same class of bug already fixed in `tpa()`, `area()`, `carbon()`, `biomass()`, `volume()`, and `dwm()`; see above -- `invasive()` was the one remaining estimator missing this fix). Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected.
+ Fixed a bug in `invasive()` where an `areaDomain`/`landType` restriction matching no data could produce a spurious `"no non-missing arguments to max"` warning instead of a clean empty result, unlike every other estimation function (which this warning class was already fixed for). Root cause: the population-estimation branch was missing a filter to drop conditions with no detected invasive species, present only in the (separate) `byPlot` branch's code; when every species group was empty, the resulting phantom "no species" row(s), rather than a genuinely empty result, bypassed the existing 0-row guard in the shared `combineMR()` utility.

### `biomass()` and `carbon()`

+ `biomass()` no longer estimates carbon (`CARB_ACRE`/`CARB_TOTAL`/associated SE and variance columns have been removed from its output). Tree biomass estimation is otherwise unchanged. Use `carbon()` for carbon stock estimation, which covers the full suite of forest ecosystem carbon pools (live and dead trees, understory vegetation, down dead wood, litter, and soil organic matter), not just standing tree carbon.
+ Fixed a bug in `carbon()` and `biomass()` where `nPlots_AREA` did not reflect restrictions imposed by `landType` or `areaDomain`, instead always reporting the plot count for the broader unrestricted land base (the same class of bug already fixed in `tpa()` and `area()`; see above). Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected. For `carbon()` specifically, this also caused an `areaDomain` matching no conditions to return a row of `NaN` values instead of a clean empty result, since `carbon()`'s numerator is built by joining onto the same phantom-row-containing condition list; this is now a clean 0-row result, consistent with every other estimation function.
+ Fixed a bug in `biomass()` where `nPlots_TREE` over-counted plots for any `component` (or `byComponent`) request restricted to `STEM`, `STEM_BARK`, `STUMP_BARK`, `BOLE`, `BOLE_BARK`, or `BRANCH`, in states with a meaningful amount of woodland-form forest (e.g. pinyon-juniper woodland in Arizona, Utah, and Colorado). NSVB does not model these components for woodland species (`DRYBIO_STEM`/etc. are `NA`, not 0, for e.g. juniper and pinyon), and while their 0 contribution to `BIO_ACRE`/`BIO_ACRE_SE` was already handled correctly, plots whose only tallied trees were woodland species were still being counted toward `nPlots_TREE`. This inflated `nPlots_TREE` by up to ~3x in woodland-heavy states (e.g. Arizona `BRANCH`: 3137 reported vs. 842 actual contributing plots); point estimates and sampling errors were not affected.

### `areaChange()`

+ Fixed a bug in `areaChange()` where a condition that was nonsampled (`COND_STATUS_CD == 5`, e.g. hazardous or denied-access) at either measurement was misclassified as a genuine forest/non-forest (or timberland/non-timberland) land-use change event, since the shared `landTypeDomain()` helper has no distinct category for "nonsampled" -- it simply isn't forest, indistinguishable from a real non-forest reclassification. This fabricated diversion/reversion events that never actually occurred, and could bias `AREA_CHNG`/`PERC_CHNG` in either direction depending on how the affected plots happened to fall; confirmed on real data that this flipped the sign of the reported net change in forest area for Rhode Island. `area()` was not affected (a nonsampled condition simply contributes no area there, rather than being paired against a different point in time).

### `area()`

+ Fixed a bug in `area()` where a hard-coded `PLOT_STATUS_CD == 1` filter (a leftover from code shared with `tpa()`, where it is valid since trees only occur on forest land) silently dropped every plot with no accessible forest before land-type domain indicators were applied. This caused large undercounts (up to two orders of magnitude) for every `landType` value other than the defaults of `'forest'`/`'timber'` (e.g. `'water'`, `'non-forest'`, `'all'`), and caused the documented `byLandType = TRUE` output to sum to well under the true total land area. `landType = 'forest'`/`'timber'` estimates were not affected.
+ Fixed a bug in `area()` where `nPlots_AREA_DEN` did not reflect restrictions imposed by `landType = 'timber'` or `areaDomain`, instead always reporting the plot count for the broader `landType = 'forest'` land base (the same class of bug as the `tpa()` `nPlots_AREA` fix described below). Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected.
+ Updated `area()` where `landType = 'all'` to now explicitly remove nonsampled conditions from the land area calculation (e.g. hazardous or denied-access plots). In prior versions, nonsampled conditions were included in the count of `landType = 'all'`, but this resulted in the sum of the different components when `byLandType = TRUE` to not sum to the total when `landType = 'all'`. 
+ Fixed a bug where `method = 'ANNUAL'` silently summed together every constituent panel's population
  estimate into a single, badly inflated row (with an inflated plot count to match) instead of
  reporting each sampled panel-year's own estimate separately, whenever it was run against a database
  that had been restricted to a single "most recent" evaluation (e.g. via `clipFIA(mostRecent = TRUE)`).
  Confirmed on Rhode Island: `area(clipFIA(fiaRI, mostRecent = TRUE), method = 'ANNUAL')` previously
  returned a single row (labeled with the evaluation's nominal year) that was actually the sum of all 7
  constituent panels' area estimates; it now correctly returns 7 separate rows, one per sampled
  panel-year, matching the values obtained by running `method = 'ANNUAL'` against the full, unclipped
  inventory history. Root cause: a shared internal utility (`combineMR()`, used to reconcile different
  states' differing "most recent" reporting years under the `'TI'`/`'SMA'`/`'LMA'`/`'EMA'` estimators)
  was also being unconditionally applied to `'ANNUAL'` output, which legitimately contains multiple
  distinct-year rows per state -- `combineMR()` relabeled all of them to the same year, causing a
  subsequent aggregation step to sum them together. This affects every estimation function that
  supports `method = 'ANNUAL'` (not just `area()`), since `combineMR()` is shared internal utility;
  confirmed the identical corruption and fix for `tpa()`. `'TI'`, `'SMA'`, `'LMA'`, and `'EMA'` were not
  affected, since they already returned a single row per state before reaching this step.

### `volume()`

+ Fixed a bug in `volume()` where `nPlots_AREA` did not reflect restrictions imposed by `landType` or `areaDomain`, instead always reporting the plot count for the broader unrestricted land base (the same class of bug already fixed in `tpa()`, `area()`, `carbon()`, and `biomass()`; see above -- `volume()` was the one remaining estimator missing this fix). Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected.
+ Fixed two related bugs in `volume()` where `nPlots_TREE` over-counted plots: (1) trees with no defined bole volume (e.g. dead trees under 5 inches DBH, for which `VOLCFNET` is never computed) were still counted, the same class of bug just fixed in `biomass()` but triggered by tree diameter rather than species; and (2) trees with a defined but exactly-zero net volume (a full cull/defect deduction can legitimately zero out `VOLCFNET`) were counted, where EVALIDator's own definitions require a strictly positive volume to count a tree as contributing. Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected; `nPlots_TREE` was inflated by a few percent in the states checked (e.g. Rhode Island `treeType = 'dead'`: 107 reported vs. 103 actual contributing plots).

### `dwm()`

+ Fixed a bug in `dwm()` where `nPlots_AREA` did not reflect restrictions imposed by `landType` or `areaDomain`, instead always reporting the plot count for the broader unrestricted land base (the same class of bug already fixed in `tpa()`, `area()`, `carbon()`, `biomass()`, and `volume()`; see above -- `dwm()` was the one remaining estimator missing this fix). Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected.
+ Fixed a bug in `dwm()` where `COND_DWM_CALC` was filtered by `PLT_CN` alone when restricting to the current evaluation, but a single plot can appear in `COND_DWM_CALC` under several different `EVALID`s (consecutive annual panels can each report the same not-yet-remeasured plot as their most recent down woody material data), each with slightly different evaluation/stratum-specific adjustment factors. This caused every down woody material condition to be summed once per matching `EVALID` instead of once, inflating the reported `nPlots_DWM` plot count by roughly 4-5x in the states checked (e.g. Colorado: 17775 reported vs. 3897 actual contributing plots) and, more subtly, adding spurious phantom estimation-unit groups with no effect on the final point estimate or standard error (their area contribution was always `NA` and dropped), but real effect on the plot count. Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected; only `nPlots_DWM` was.
+ Fixed a bug in `dwm()` where `nPlots_DWM` counted every domain-qualifying, DWM-sampled plot regardless of whether it actually had any down woody material of the relevant fuel type, instead of requiring a strictly positive value (matching EVALIDator's own per-attribute definitions, and the same class of fix just made in `volume()`). This was checked and fixed separately for the combined default output (`byFuelType = FALSE`, which requires total FWD + CWD + pile volume across all fuel types to be positive, matching EVALIDator's combined "Total volume of DWM" attribute) and for `byFuelType = TRUE`'s individual fuel-type rows (each of which now requires only its own fuel type's volume -- or biomass, for `DUFF`/`LITTER`, which have no volume equivalent -- to be positive, matching each fuel type's own EVALIDator attribute). Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected.
+ Fixed a bug in `dwm()` under `method = 'SMA'`, `'LMA'`, `'EMA'`, and `'ANNUAL'` where the down woody material numerator was post-stratified using each plot's original stratum assignment (from `COND_DWM_CALC`), while the area denominator used the strata produced after small strata were merged (needed for variance estimation of annual panels). Plots moved into a neighboring stratum were therefore assigned to different strata in the numerator and denominator. Under the moving-average methods, numerator rows with no matching denominator stratum/panel/group were silently dropped, so down woody material totals were underestimated, and totals across `grpBy` groups did not sum to the ungrouped total (e.g. Colorado, `areaDomain = PHYSCLCD %in% 21:29`, `method = 'SMA'`: 13.75 vs. 14.47 billion cubic feet after the fix). The numerator now uses the same (merged) strata as the denominator. Estimates with `method = 'TI'` (the default) were not affected.

### `tpa()`

+ Fixed a bug in `tpa()` where `nPlots_AREA` did not reflect restrictions imposed by `landType = 'timber'` or `areaDomain`, instead always reporting the plot count for the broader `landType = 'forest'` land base. Point estimates and sampling errors were not affected, but `nPlots_AREA` is documented as the recommended degrees of freedom for constructing t-based confidence intervals, so an inflated count understated the true margin of error for any `landType = 'timber'` or `areaDomain`-restricted estimate.
+ Fixed a bug where a `treeDomain`/`areaDomain` matching no data, combined with the default `mostRecent = TRUE` behavior, produced a spurious `"no non-missing arguments to max"` warning instead of a clean empty result. This affected all estimation functions (not just `tpa()`), since the underlying cause was in a shared internal utility.
+ Documented in `tpa.Rd` why tree records with a missing diameter (`DIA`) -- most often standing dead
  trees revisited after death, common in western US inventories -- are excluded from `tpa()` estimates
  regardless of `treeType`: these records also lack `TPA_UNADJ` (FIA's per-acre expansion factor, which
  itself depends on `DIA` to determine subplot design), so they have no valid per-acre weight under
  FIA's design-based estimator and are excluded from EVALIDator's estimates for the same reason.
  Confirmed `treeType = 'dead'` still matches EVALIDator to full precision in OR, where this affects a
  large fraction of dead-tree records (issue #32).
+ Fixed a bug where `method = 'EMA'` silently accepted a `lambda` outside its documented `(0,1)` range
  and returned degenerate weights instead of an error -- `NaN` for every panel at the exact boundaries
  (`lambda = 0` or `1`), a negative weight for `lambda < 0`, or an inverted (oldest-weighted-highest)
  recency ordering for `lambda > 1`. `lambda` is now validated up front with a clear error message.
  This affected every estimation function (not just `tpa()`), since the underlying weighting logic is a
  shared internal utility used by all of them, plus `fsi()` and `customPSE()`.
+ Fixed a bug where `method = 'ANNUAL'` did not correctly select the best FIA evaluation to draw a
  panel's standalone estimate from, when that panel is a constituent of more than one evaluation's
  multi-panel window (common: e.g. panel year 2009 is part of both a 2013 evaluation's 5-panel window
  and a 2014 evaluation's window). The comparison across candidate evaluations was accidentally a
  no-op, so which one's numbers ended up in the output was arbitrary (whichever came first
  internally) rather than the one with the most plots, as intended. This affected every estimation
  function using `method = 'ANNUAL'`, since the underlying selection logic is a shared internal
  utility.

### `plotFIA()`

+ Fixed a bug in `plotFIA()` where `animate = TRUE` errored with `could not find function
  "transition_manual"` for any non-spatial (time-series) summary, since `transition_manual()` was
  called unqualified rather than as `gganimate::transition_manual()` -- `gganimate` is a `Suggests`
  dependency only, never attached by `library()`. The analogous call in the spatial (choropleth map)
  branch was already correctly qualified. This is the same class of bug fixed in v1.1.1, which only
  fixed the spatial branch's call.
+ Fixed a bug in `plotFIA()` where saving an animated plot (`animate = TRUE` with `savePath`/`fileName`)
  always errored with `could not find function "anim_save"`, for the same reason as above --
  `anim_save()` is now called as `gganimate::anim_save()`.
+ Implemented the `min.year` argument, which was documented ("earliest year to be included in
  animation") but had no effect on the returned plot. `animate = TRUE` now drops years before
  `min.year` from the animation; static plots are unaffected.

### `writeFIA()`

+ Fixed a bug in `writeFIA()` where 16-digit CNs (e.g., `CN`, `PLT_CN`, `PREV_PLT_CN`) were silently
  rounded to 15 significant digits on writing (e.g., `1097572188290487` was written as
  `1097572188290490`), since `data.table::fwrite()` writes doubles with at most 15 significant digits.
  Because recent FIADB CNs have 16 digits, reading tables with `readFIA()`, modifying them, and saving
  them with `writeFIA()` broke the joins between the saved tables and any unmodified ones (e.g., COND
  rows no longer matched their PLOT and TREE rows), dropping recent plots from all subsequent
  estimates. CN columns are now written as exact integers.

### Vignettes

+ Added a new vignette ("Validating rFIA against EVALIDator") that reports, for each estimation
  function, how many unit tests compare `rFIA` estimates to EVALIDator and whether they passed, along
  with a history of results across test runs.

### Documentation

+ Updated the link to Bechtold and Patterson (2005) in all help files and the "FIA Demystified" vignette to its new location
  (https://research.fs.usda.gov/download/treesearch/20371.pdf).

# rFIA v1.1.4

+ Removed `.dots` argument from all calls to `dplyr::group_by()`, which resulted in an error with the latest version of `dplyr` (see [#54](https://github.com/doserjef/rFIA/issues/54)).  
+ Removed dependency on the `bit64` package. 
+ Removed `N` from the return output of all model fitting functions as this was not always being properly calculated when different filters were applied. Additionally, we updated our recommended approach for calculating confidence intervals and so this value is no longer part of that recommended calculation. 
+ Removed the argument `variance` from all estimation functions, with the exception of `fsi()`. Previous documentation was misleading in that it said valid confidence intervals cannot be constructed from the sampling errors. This is not strictly true. The sampling error is a function of the variance/standard error, and so the sampling error *can* be used to calcualte confidence intervals when manipulated appropriately. See the note in all model fitting functions documentation for further details on how to do this. 
+ Confidence interval calculations provided by `fsi()` were too precise. This has been updated to better reflect the amount of uncertainty in the associated estimates. Confidence intervals are now calculated with the number of plots used to inform the given FSI estimate, not the number of plots within all estimation units that encompass the population of interest. Consider the case where we calculate FSI for an individual species. Because FSI is a measure of change over time, only plots where the species was present at for at least one time point go into informing the FSI estimate. The previous use of all plots, even those without the species of interest, substantially inflated the sample size.  
+ Fixed some minor bugs in `plotFIA()` that errored when including error bars. Also fixed code to remove a warning message in simple time series plots.  
+ Updated the "Estimating Forest Attributes" document, particularly the section on sampling error and how to calculate confidence intervals. 

# rFIA v1.1.3

+ Substantial updates to the `fsi()` function. Some of these functions fixed some common errors that could be encountered under specific circumstances where the function broke, which happened as a result of updates to FIADB since the last time this function underwent a major update. An additional update fixes an important bug where the `scaleBy` function would not always work as was reported. In particular, under certain situations (namely `byPlot = TRUE`) the subsequent calculations of relative density did not use the level-specific intercepts and slopes that were estimated in the regression model, and instead the overall mean was used (i.e., equivalent to if `scaleBy` was not specified). This could lead to sub-optimal accuracy of the relative density calculations, and in subsequent FSI outputs. Apologies for any problems this may have caused.  
+ Updated the `biomass()` function to fix a bug in reported estimates when `component = 'TOTAL'`. There was a mismatch in what was reported between the documentation and the function output. The estimate provided simply added up all biomass across the different components provided by `biomass()`, which did not make much sense since the different components are not mutually exclusive. This is now fixed such that `component = 'TOTAL'` provides biomass estimates equal to the sum of ROOT, STEM, STEM_BARK, BRANCH, and FOLIAGE components. Apologies for the inconvenience this error may have caused.  

# rFIA v1.1.2

+ Updated all estimation functions to allow grouping by variables in the `PLOTGEOM` database table within the `grpBy` argument. Also changed `readFIA()` to by default read in `PLOTGEOM` as one of the common database tables. Thanks to Jacob Fraser for the suggestion [here](https://github.com/doserjef/rFIA/issues/55).
+ [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/doserjef/rFIA/pull/58) with `dtplyr 1.3.2` that led to an error in `areaChange()` 


# rFIA v1.1.1

+ Jeff Doser is the new package maintainer. Please send all inquiries via email to Jeff (jwdoser@ncsu.edu) or post potential bugs on the GitHub development page.  
+ Updated the `fiaRI` object to reflect recent changes in the FIA Database. These changes resulted in the package functions successfully working with the previous version of `fiaRI` but not working for actual user data when pulling data from recent versions of the FIA Database.
+ Updated functionality for working with external spatial (`sf`) objects with the following functions: `tpa()`. Changes in recent versions of the `sf` package led to errors when attempting to return a spatial object. This bug is now fixed.
+ Updated a substantial bug in `area()` and `areaChange()` that resulted in incorrect area (or area change) estimates being reported when specifying `treeDomain` and `grpBy` (when using grouping variables from TREE). In the previous version, the filters were not properly applied, and so area estimates did not adequately represent the filtering conditions and often just provided the same values as if `treeDomain` was not specified. Estimates now provide correct results that are more inline with intuition. For example, if specifying `treeDomain = SPCD == 121` [i.e., longleaf pine], the previous `area()` function would essentially ignore this and return area of all forest plots. Now, `area()` will return the estimate of land area where at least one longleaf pine tree occurs. Further, the estimate of percent area will be the percentage of total land area (which is determined by `landType`) that contains longleaf pine.  
+ Substantial updates to `biomass()`. Previous versions were not compatible with updates in FIADB and the new National Scale Volume and Biomass (NSVB) estimators. The function is now updated and returns biomass and carbon estimates using the NSVB procedure. 
+ Updated `findEVALID()` to return the correct evaluation IDs. Previous versions had an incorrect join that resulted in additional, incorrect EVALIDs being returned for a given set of criteria. This function should only be used by users familiar with FIA and desiring to use FIA data for use outside of `rFIA`, as `rFIA` is built in a way that users do not need to directly interact with EVALIDs. 
+ Updated `dwm()` when `byPlot = TRUE` to set the `YEAR` column equal to the year each plot was measured (`MEASYEAR`), which may differ slightly from its associated inventory year (`INVYR`). This is what all other `rFIA` functions do and what was reported in the manual, but the `YEAR` returned prior to this version was actually the inventory year. 
+ Fixed a bug with `growMort()` that resulted in estimates of mean annual survivor growth and mean annual net change reporting as 0.
+ Fixed a discrepancy with `growMort()` calculation of removals and the description of it in the manual. Removal estimates provided by `growMort()` do NOT include stems that grow beyond the 5-inch diameter threshold and then are subject to harvest or natural mortality before the remeasurement period. In other words, `rFIA` recruitment does not include trees corresponding to FIA growth components of CUT2 and MORTALITY2.  
+ Fixed a typo in the `standStruct()` documentation that incorrectly said the lower diameter for Pole class was set at 11cm while it is in fact set at 12.7cm (5in).  
+ Fixed typo in documentation of `plotFIA()` regarding the error bars produced when `se = TRUE`. These are 95% confidence intervals, not 68% confidence intervals.
+ Added more details to `vegStruct()` on reporting of estimates by canopy layer and growth habit.
+ Updated internal data to now contain the Dec 2024 `REF_SPECIES` table from FIADB, which provides access to the `CARBON_RATIO_LIVE` attribute for using the NSVB species-specific carbon fractions. 
+ Updated all estimation functions to fix a bug that resulted in an error when setting `method = 'EMA'`. 
+ Removed all references to "ECOSUBCD" in the help pages since this column was removed from the PLOT table in FIADB v9.3. 
+ Updated `writeFIA()` to allow users to write database tables by state when only a subset of the table is originally read into R. This currently requires either the PLOT or COND tables to be read in.  
+ Fixed a bug in `plotFIA()` that led to an error in animated plots when `gganimate` was not loaded (note that `gganimate` still needs to be installed).
