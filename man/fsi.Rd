\arguments{
  \item{db}{\code{FIA.Database} object produced from \code{\link{readFIA}}; Function requires that PLOT, TREE, COND, POP_PLOT_STRATUM_ASSGN, POP_ESTN_UNIT, POP_EVAL, POP_STRATUM, POP_EVAL_TYP, POP_EVAL_GRP tables exist in FIA.Database object.}

\item{grpBy}{variables from PLOT, COND, or TREE tables to group estimates by (NOT quoted). Multiple grouping variables should be combined with \code{c()}, and grouping will occur heirarchically. For example, to produce seperate estimates for each ownership group within ecoregion subsections, specify \code{c(ECOSUBCD, OWNGRPCD)}.}

  \item{polys}{\code{sp} or \code{sf} Polygon/MultiPolgyon object; Areal units to bin data for estimation. Seperate estimates will be produces for region encompassed by each areal unit.}

  \item{returnSpatial}{logical; if TRUE, return sf spatial object (polys must also be specified).}

\item{bySpecies}{logical; if TRUE, returns estimates grouped by species.}

  \item{bySizeClass}{logical; if TRUE, returns estimates grouped by size class (2-inch intervals, see \code{\link{makeClasses}} to compute different size class intervals).}

  \item{landType}{character ('forest' or 'timber'); Type of land which estimates will be produced for. Timberland is a subset of forestland (default) which has high site potential and non-reserve status (see details).}

  \item{treeType}{character ('all', 'live', 'dead', or 'gs'); Type of tree which estimates will be produced for. All (default) includes all stems, live and dead, greater than 1 in. DBH. Live/Dead includes all stems greater than 1 in. DBH which are live or dead (leaning less than 45 degrees), respectively. GS (growing-stock) includes live stems greater than 5 in. DBH which contain at least one 8 ft merchantable log. }

  \item{method}{character; Method used for annual panel combination (see details). One of: 'TI' (temporally indifferent), 'annual' (annual panels), 'SMA' (simple moving average), 'LMA' (linear moving average), or 'EMA' (exponential moving average)}

  \item{lambda}{numeric (0,1); if \code{method == 'EMA'}, the decay parameter used to define weighting scheme for annual panels. Low values place higher weight on more recent panels, and vice versa. Specify a vector of values to compute estimates using mulitple wieghting schemes, and use \code{plotFIA} with \code{grp} set to \code{lambda} to produce moving average ribbon plots.}

  \item{treeDomain}{logical predicates defined in terms of the variables in PLOT, TREE, and/or COND tables. Used to define the type of trees for which estimates will be produced (e.g. DBH greater than 20 inches: \code{DIA > 20}, Dominant/Co-dominant crowns only: \code{CCLCD \%in\% c(2,3))}. Multiple conditions are combined with \code{&} (and) or \code{|} (or). Only trees where the condition evaluates to TRUE are used in producing estimates. Should NOT be quoted.}

  \item{areaDomain}{logical predicates defined in terms of the variables in PLOT and/or COND tables. Used to define the area for which estimates will be produced (e.g. within 1 mile of improved road: \code{RDDISTCD \%in\% c(1:6)}, Hard maple/basswood forest type: \code{FORTYPCD == 805)}. Multiple conditions are combined with \code{&} (and) or \code{|} (or). Only plots within areas where the condition evaluates to TRUE are used in producing estimates. Should NOT be quoted.}

  \item{totals}{logical; if TRUE, return population estimates (e.g. total area, total biomass) along with ratio estimates (e.g. mean biomass per acre).}

  \item{variance}{logical; if TRUE, return estimates of uncertainty as variance instead of sampling error (default). Sampling error cannot be used to estimate confidence intervals.}

  \item{byPlot}{logical; if TRUE, returns estimates for individual plot locations (population totals not returned).}

  \item{useSeries}{logical; If TRUE, use multiple remeasurements to estimate change in TPA & BA on each plot, when available.}

  \item{scaleBy}{variables from PLOT or COND tables to use as 'random effects' in model of size-density relationships.Multiple variables should be combined with \code{c()}, and grouping will occur heirarchically. For example, to produce seperate estimates for each ownership group within ecoregion subsections, specify \code{c(FORTYPCD, SITECLCD)}.}
  \item{betas}{more soon.}

  \item{returnBetas}{more soon.}

  \item{nCores}{numeric; number of cores to use for parallel implementation. Check available cores using \code{\link{detectCores}}. Default = 1, serial processing.}

\value{
Dataframe or SF object (if \code{returnSpatial = TRUE}). If \code{byPlot = TRUE}, totals are returned for each plot. All variables with names ending in \code{SE} represent the estimate of sampling error (\%) of the variable. All variables with names ending in \code{TOTAL} represent the population total of the variable.

\itemize{
      \item{\strong{YEAR}: reporting year associated with estimates}
      \item{\strong{SI}: estimate of forest stability index }
      \item{\strong{SI_STATUS}: indication of the forest stability index (i.e., decline, stable, or expand)}
      \item{\strong{SI_INT}: width of 95\% confidence interval of mean FSI}
      \item{\strong{TPA_RATE}: standardized estimate of annual change in TPA}
      \item{\strong{BAA_RATE}: standardized estimate of annual change in BAA}
